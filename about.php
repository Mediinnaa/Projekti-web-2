  <p> When we started Orphic Beauty, we set out to make the world of beauty and grooming simple.<br>
    What we've learned along the way is that it's about so much more than that.<br>
    What we made resonated with customers who have felt overlooked by an entire industry because beauty and grooming aren't their top priorities.<br>
    People with jobs, families, hobbies, passions, and extremely full lives who deserve to have an experience on their terms.<br>
    Not the overwhelming, exclusive, high-expectation norms of this industry.<br>
    But more than being simple, we made something personal. We made something you see as a gift to you.</p>
